    "Preprocessing options currently consist of resampling, silence removal, and segmenting the clips, in that order. This happens when you label your items (e.g. call `label_from_folder()`). These actions can take several minutes, and possibly longer for large datasets, thus we automatically cache the results for you so that the process doesn't have to be repeated. This happens even if `cache_spectro=False` in your Config, that feature is for spectrogram caching only. This will allow you to try different configurations as quickly as possible. The caching happens at each stage, so if you change your settings for silence removal, the library will not need to repeat the resampling, but will instead pull the resampled files from the cache and resume silence removal.

    "Rolling a spectrogram just means shifting along it's x-axis and wrapping around from the end to the beginning as to not lose any information. Whether this is useful to you depends on your data. Ask yourself if your data would make sense a bit out of order. Traffic noise wrapped would still be traffic noise, but the word \"hello\" wouldn't be the word \"hello\". Also, if you are using mixup and specAugment, you may have confused your model sufficiently that rolling isn't going to help. Still we've found it to help in some cases so it is included.\n",

Once you've done that and feel comfortable with the settings, check out our kaggle audio competition notebooks to see how to tune things and get world class results. \n",
